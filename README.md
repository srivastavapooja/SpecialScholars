The Special Scholars app provides age appropriate, academic lessons to children with special need or learning difficulties. The lessons are presented in a simple format and give a basic understanding of topics included in regular school curriculum. The lessons are categorized into 3 levels - Beginner, Advanced and Expert, roughly mapping to the academic levels of Grade 1 to Grade 5. Each chapter has a quiz at the end. The quiz questions are built in a way such that the student can respond by choice making. The chapters and quizes are aimed at improving the receptive understanding of the child with age level content.
